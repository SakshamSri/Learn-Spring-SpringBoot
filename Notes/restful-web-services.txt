Dispatcher Servlet handles all the requests and mappings. It tells the Message Converter (here Jackson) to convert the bean to JSON format for output. It is mapped to [/] on the application so any requests that comes goes through it.

If we return void when creating user via Post, the status returned automatically will be 200OK.
For user creation, we want status code to be 201Created. To do so, we use ServletUriComponentsBuilder and ResponseEntity.

We should always have a common Exception Structure for all kinds of errors.
We create a exception structure and a common handler and then extend to all exceptions accross application using ResponseEntityExceptionHandler.
If we have multiple controller classes, we can share something (like common exception) across all controllers using @ControllerAdvice
