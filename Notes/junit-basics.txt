Junit can be run in continous integrations (at freq intervals or whenever there is code change, etc)

@Before -> run before every test
@After -> run after every test

@BeforeClass -> run before all tests run (first thing) -> should be static
@AfterClass -> run after all tests run (last thing) -> should be static

Order:
BeforeClass
Before
Test1
After
Before
Test2
