Junit can be run in continous integrations (at freq intervals or whenever there is code change, etc)

@BeforeEach -> run before every test
@AfterEach -> run after every test

@BeforeAll -> run before all tests run (first thing) -> should be static
@AfterAll -> run after all tests run (last thing) -> should be static

Order:
BeforeAll
BeforeEach
Test1
AfterEach
BeforeEach
Test2
AfterEach
AfterAll

@SpringBootTest -> you want to add the spring context itself (not only the test) and then the test is run and then context destroyed. from junit5, default this is added and context launches.

@DirtiesContext -> resets the data that is being altered in the test
