Junit can be run in continous integrations (at freq intervals or whenever there is code change, etc)

@BeforeEach -> run before every test
@AfterEach -> run after every test

@BeforeAll -> run before all tests run (first thing) -> should be static
@AfterAll -> run after all tests run (last thing) -> should be static

Order:
BeforeAll
BeforeEach
Test1
AfterEach
BeforeEach
Test2
AfterEach
AfterAll
